# v1.0 BETA # -- Updated notes pending
First off; a massive thank you to DeadAir for creating the script which spawns the Reclaimer fleets. Without their support that feature would likely have never been implemented properly, so thank you again, DeadAir, for putting up with this amateur and for your support and effort. A thank you to **7thCore for making the Farnham's Legend** mod which served as the inspiration and springboard for this project. I knew nothing about sector creation before starting this and learned via their work. Another thank you to Sira and JkelleyK for helping me catch my syntax errors and listening to my rambles.


New Xenon War is a ***VRO dependent mod*** and will not function without it and is intended to be complementary with Sira's AI mods. The goal of the mod is to bolster the Xenon in their core sectors by gradually introducing additional, rebuildable, forces. The concept of this mod is an evolution of **arshiba's "Xenon Reconfig"** and the unique Xenon ship fleets keep the same naming scheme; '***System Analyst***'. It also creates 2 new clusters controlled by the Xenon. Creates 2 new Xenon M-class frigates using the P hull design; the PX heavy bomber and the D gunboat. 


The Xenon core sectors are those which spawn with a Shipyard and Wharf at the beginning of the game. These fleets are defensive but unfortunately sometimes the AI will use them offensively if they are chasing a target or they just feel like it. The AI is a mystery wrapped in an enigma but I am trying to resolve that issue. 

### **New Sectors** ###
[Bad Debt] -  Connected to Path to Profit via an East gate. 

[Matrix #695A and B] - Matrix #695A (and B) to Windfall III via a West gate. If using the Uncharted Skies version it is Windfall IV via a Southeast gate.

Both sectors are fully voiced by Betty and are self-sufficient for maximum Xenon production. Bad Debt is a good source of methane and an industrial hub at the heart of the Commonwealth if you can take it out but that was designed pre-Uncharted Skies. Oh and they have lore since they are recreated X3 systems.


### **New Ships** ###
D - Xenon inspired gunboat intended to help screen fighters better. I noticed that while the Xenon are the swarmers that they do not do so well when they are swarmed. The D should help, I hope. The D should appear fairly regularly but its spawn rate is lower than the P.

PX - At the moment, the PX is a big brother to VRO’s LX as it features 2 of the torpedo tubes and carries 4 additional torps. I am considering changing this to using the VRO plasma bomb weapons which are on a select few gunboats since the LX torps are both loved and hated.. Mostly hated. The PX has a **very** low spawn chance outside of the sector specific jobs.

Both ships are voiced by Betty.


The following Activations occur at the same time in each of the 9 core sectors:

### **Wave 1 (2 hours)** ###
- Immediately spawns 2 fleets of 1 PX, 5 LXs bombers, and 4 fighters (N, M, and/or LX). This wave has a capacity of 4 fleets -- This is intended to serve in an anti-capital ship / anti-surface module role and is not something that should be taken lightly. The additional fighters are for support/fodder. 


### **Civilian Wave (3 hours)** ###
- Immediately adds 2|1 miners/transports to the Xenon economy with cap of 4|3. This is to prepare for the next waves with additional resources for ship production but might be removed since the AI/War mods already add several as-is.


### **Wave 2 (4 hours)** ### 
- Immediately spawns 1 fleet of 3 Destroyers, 5 frigates (P, D, or low chance PX), and 4 fighters (N, M, and/or LX). This wave has a capacity of 2 and is to further boost the capital ships actively defending a sector which might be lagging behind due to high consumption of starting resources.


### **Wave 3 (8 hours)**  ###
- Immediately spawns 1 fleet of 1 U, 2  Destroyers, and a wing of 24 N/M fighters. This wave has a capacity of 1. In VRO this ship doesn't start spawning until 60 hrs have passed ingame and that seems so long to start to see the Xenon U carrier but Shuulo's is offensive whereas these are very much not intended to be. They look cool but overall this wave isn’t that dangerous, originally this was 1 I and 2 Us.


### **Reclaimers**  ###
- Immediately spawns once the Xenon Core Sector changes from Xenon control to any other status. Contains 1 I, 4 Destroyers, 10 frigates, and 10 LX bombers. Think of this fleet as the boss of a Xenon Core. It is intentionally very dangerous to capital ships and is supposed to punish any cheesy tactic of sniping out Defense Platforms and/or give a big “oomph” against organic invasions. As a warning, this fleet DOES have Factionlogic so it **will** be used offensively. Once this boss spawns, it has to be killed. If a sector is retaken by the Xenon and then lost again, they will respawn. You have been warned.

### **Notes** ###
As this is an developing project there will likely be lots of tweaking, balancing, and of course new additions. There will be 2 versions, [New Xenon War] and [New Xenon War - Uncharted Skies]. I am hoping to make more sectors but they would be different than the Branch 9 Xenon. I am also really hoping to learn ship creation as I would like to introduce new Xenon ships and give proper new hulls to the D and PX. Any future updates will be made with the goal of save compatibility but these might need to change.
